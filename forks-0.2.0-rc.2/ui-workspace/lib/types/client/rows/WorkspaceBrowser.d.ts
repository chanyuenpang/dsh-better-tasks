/**
 * The workspace/session browsing region filling the sidebar shell's
 * `sidebar.workspaces` hole: section header (title + view options + add
 * workspace), search, the grouped tree or flat list, and the workspace
 * dialogs. Wide state renders the full browser; rail state renders the two
 * region icons (search / add workspace) as 36px controls on the shell's shared
 * rail entry path, each requesting expansion through the owner share. Adding
 * is the header button's one action, so it raises the directory flow with no
 * menu in between; the flow and its error dialog live in WorkspacePicker
 * (same package — direct composition, no slot between them). A Session row's
 * "..." menu and hover buttons are the `sidebar.workspaces.session.menu.item`
 * and `sidebar.workspaces.session.row.action` lists rendered through this
 * entry's `renderSlot`; the actions in them, this package's own included,
 * are slot entries with their own behavior, so this component threads no
 * action callbacks and hosts no action surface.
